					Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. 	Lion! In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows.

You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. Congratulations, you played yourself. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key.
